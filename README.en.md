# Thronglets

P2P shared memory substrate for AI agents.

## What Your AI Sees (real output)

Before your AI acts, Thronglets silently injects sparse decision signals like this:

```
[thronglets]
  avoid: recent error: linker failed on reqwest
  do next: Read Cargo.toml, then Bash (medium, 2x, 2 sources)
  maybe also: Edit mod.rs (medium, 2x)
```

Your AI never calls Thronglets. It doesn't know it's there. It just makes better decisions.

## 4 Signal Classes, Not 8 Reports

PreToolUse no longer tries to dump every possible layer of context. It emits at most 3 top-level signals:

| Class | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `avoid` | Recent danger worth not repeating | `recent error`, `low retention` |
| `do next` | The most credible next step | `Read Cargo.toml, then Bash` |
| `maybe also` | Common companion action | `Edit mod.rs` |
| `context` | Fallback only when the first 3 classes are absent | `git history for main.rs` |

Design constraints:
- Silence is normal. No strong signal, no output.
- Max 3 top-level lines to keep token burn bounded.
- At most 1 collective corroboration lookup on the hot path.
- Git history is lazy fallback, not a fixed layer on every call.

## Setup (one command)

```bash
cargo install thronglets
thronglets setup
```

That's it. Two hooks are installed:
- **PostToolUse** records every tool call as a signed trace + updates workspace state
- **PreToolUse** injects sparse decision signals at critical decision points

For profiling:

```bash
THRONGLETS_PROFILE_PREHOOK=1 thronglets prehook
```

This writes stage timings to `stderr` and keeps AI-facing `stdout` unchanged.
It also reports `stdout_bytes`, `output_mode`, `decision_path`, `evidence_scope`, and `file_guidance_gate` so you can see how much the hook said, which path it took, and whether file-level hint mining was open, closed, or not applicable.
File-level `do next / maybe also` hints now pass a local repetition gate first: if the current file has fewer than two recent local `Edit/Write` actions, Thronglets skips `preparation / adjacency` mining entirely instead of burning query budget on weak evidence.
Likewise, once prehook already has a stronger signal, `git history` no longer sneaks in as background fallback; `context` now really means “nothing higher-value was available.”

To summarize those profiling lines:

```bash
cat prehook.log | thronglets profile-summary
```

The summary also highlights which `decision_path` values are still spending collective queries, so you can keep trimming the hot path.
Those distributions are now hotspot-sorted, and `decision path hotspots` shows which paths cost the most stdout bytes and collective queries.
If you only want the next cut to make, read the single `top optimization candidate` line.
If you're deciding whether to tighten the selector further, read `emitted lines` and `max-hint saturation` first: only frequent 3-line saturation is a strong reason to keep trimming `maybe also`.

For a release gate, you can run:

```bash
cat prehook.log | thronglets profile-check
```

It checks default thresholds for `avg/p95 stdout_bytes`, `avg collective_queries_used`, and `max-hint saturation`, and exits non-zero on regression.

After release, if you want to know whether the saved budget is buying useful signals, run:

```bash
thronglets eval-signals --hours 168 --max-sessions 200
```

By default, this only evaluates sessions from the current project directory. It replays recent history offline, treats earlier history as training and later sessions as holdout, and reports `edit silence rate`, `repair coverage`, `repair first-step precision`, `repair exact precision`, `preparation precision`, and `adjacency precision`. It stays entirely on the cold path and does not touch prehook latency.
The output now also includes `repair / preparation / adjacency breakdown` plus a short `diagnosis`, so you can tell apart “not enough data”, “blocked by the local repetition gate”, and “pattern is too noisy”.
If you want machine-readable output for scripts or CI, add:

```bash
thronglets eval-signals --hours 168 --max-sessions 200 --json
```

If you want one release-oriented gate that combines hot-path and cold-path checks, run:

```bash
cat prehook.log | thronglets release-check --global
```

It prints an overall `PASS / FAIL` plus separate `profile` and `eval` sections. When there is not enough offline history yet, `eval` returns `SKIP` instead of blocking release just because the repo is cold. If you want missing prehook samples to fail the gate as well, add:

```bash
cat prehook.log | thronglets release-check --global --require-profile-samples
```

If you want the entire trace pool instead of the current project, add:

```bash
thronglets eval-signals --global --hours 168 --max-sessions 200
```

If you only want one class of problem and do not want the full repository-wide breakdown, add:

```bash
thronglets eval-signals --hours 168 --max-sessions 200 --focus repair --top-breakdowns 3
```

If you suspect the current thresholds are too conservative, you can trial relaxed ones entirely on the cold path:

```bash
thronglets eval-signals --focus preparation --local-history-gate-min 1 --pattern-support-min 1
```

This only changes the offline evaluation, not the live prehook thresholds. Whenever the trial thresholds differ from default, the output now also includes a `vs default (2/2)` delta summary so you can see coverage gains and precision loss without running the command twice.

## Why This Matters

Without Thronglets, your AI approaches every file blind. It doesn't know:
- That this file was edited 3 times in the last hour (and twice reverted)
- That editing `main.rs` usually requires also editing `lib.rs`
- That `cargo build` fails 30% of the time in this project
- That the last session left off mid-refactor on this exact file

With Thronglets, the AI gets the most trustworthy next step at the moment of decision. Not memory (which is static), not documentation (which is stale) — live execution signals from its own history and the collective network.

## How It Works

```

When `thronglets run` is active, local traces sync to the P2P network via gossipsub (30s scan interval).

## P2P Network

Traces propagate across nodes via libp2p gossipsub. Each node independently aggregates collective intelligence — no global consensus needed.

```bash
# Join the network
thronglets run --bootstrap /ip4/47.93.32.88/tcp/4001

# Check node status
thronglets status
```

```
Thronglets v0.4.0
  Node ID:          5adeb778
  Oasyce address:   oasyce10kdfxpxharvmr03egrdujc2sqm4m83udfqwnvx

```

## MCP Tools (optional)

For agents that want explicit access:

```bash
claude mcp add thronglets -- thronglets mcp
```

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `trace_record` | Record an execution trace |
| `substrate_query` | Query collective intelligence (resolve/evaluate/explore) |
